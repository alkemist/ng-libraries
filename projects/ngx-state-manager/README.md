# State Manager

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.0.

## About

Inspiré de [@ngxs/store](https://github.com/ngxs/store), ce gestionnaire d'état se veut plus sobre,
et se base sur les signaux à la place des observables.

## Installation

* From npm: `npm install @alkemist/ngx-state-manager`
* From yarn: `yarn add @alkemist/ngx-state-manager`

## Test

* From npm: `npm test`
* From yarn: `yarn test`

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project ngx-state-manager` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project ngx-state-manager`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project ngx-state-manager` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file.

## Build

Run `ng build ngx-state-manager` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing
